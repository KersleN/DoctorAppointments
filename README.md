Describe the target and problems you looking to solve with technology. What inspired you to select these specific goals and targets?

· The COVID-19 pandemic was a major hit for the Mauritian society where the country was forced in two lockdowns for almost a period of 4 months each. Moreover, to limit the spreading of the virus, the concern authorities imposed severe regulations including social distancing, limited amount of people in spaces, wearing of mask and to be fully vaccinated to have access to numerous places. It was noted that due to this unprecedented situation, many people found themselves locked and unable to practice a physical activity or dieting.

· The aim of this project under the theme of Good Health and Well-being is to provide an online platform where people will have access to numerous training videos and proper diet plan to follow based on their BMI. Additionally, the proposed system will help people to perform medical diagnostics based on their symptoms. Such platform will help people to maintain a good and healthy lifestyle by staying indoors.

2. How does your solution address the challenge you are looking to solve.

The proposed system is a one -shop platform to promote a healthy and good lifestyle by:

· Provides motivation and guidance with proper exercising videos and tips.

· Help people who are stuck at home (Not fully vaccinated) by providing them with workout sessions and guidance.

· Help elderly people- compare medicines, check their symptoms and provide information about their symptoms.

· Easy to view, access and book for a doctor via the platform.

· Help people in need via donation.

3. What do you see as the future/next steps for your project? How will you expand your solution to reach a larger audience?

The proposed system will be deployed on play store to reach a higher audience. The platform will be promoted through proper marketing channels to increase awareness and acceptance. It is noted that the Mauritian government is also encouraging the concept of telemedicine and in-door trainings. This platform will serve as an initiative to the government policies.

4. Walk us through the steps you took to test your solution. Can you provide three specific feedback points you received from users that tested out your solution?

The system went through a series of unit and system testing to ensure all the functional and non-functional requirements are to the norms and standards. After clearance, a Beta test was performed with around 15-20 users for a duration of 1 week. The following points were raised:

· Menu bar (adjust it to facilitate for the user)

· Improve consistency of the layouts.

· More details of doctors to be provided

· Easy Login function for users especially elderly.

5. Please share the outcome of your testing strategy. What three specific things you implemented and improved for your solution based on the feedback from users?

Upon Beta-testing, the following amendments were done:

1) Modification of the login page

2) Adapting the platform with a consistent layout in terms of design interface. We made sure that the website has a seamless flow thought-out the whole system, creating a nice user interface following Norman Principles.

3) We made sure to adjust the menu bar, giving the user the facility to easily identify and browse through our whole system.

4) Doctor details were added.

5) A donation section that can help people in need

6. Describe the architecture that your team chose for your solution. What are the high-level components of your architecture? What is the responsibility of each component? Which specific products and platforms did you choose to implement these components? (Technologies used)

The MVC architecture was employed to design and implement the system where the following technologies was used for the front-end and back-end.

HTML - Webpage Framework and Layout CSS - Webpage Styling JavaScript - Client-Side Scripting Netlify - Website Hosting PHP – Control and logic XAMPP – Database

7. Highlight one challenge you faced while building your code, including details on how you addressed the issue and the technical decisions and implementations you had to make.

One major challenge encountered during the development of the system was while implementing the login form. Data inserted on the form was not stored in the database. Also, while login to the website user’s name was not appearing in the top right corner. The development team sought several solutions to resolve this issue. The team had to re model from scratch the database to establish a proper connection to the front-end design. The label in the form were matched with the fields of the database and the data was finally saved and retrieved for further usage.

then have to adjust our login and home page code in order for the user to see their name when successfully login in into the website as this has taken 1 week to solve this problem

8. What feedback do you have for the Google product/platforms you used? Are there any features you would like to add for those technologies?

It is noted that the team made used of google products during the research and development of the project. Chrome browser, google cloud, YouTube, google search has enabled the team to complete all research about our project.
